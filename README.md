# GeoAI Repo
### This is a project on picking up use of GeoAI python package in spatial analysis
#### The expectation is to work on different implementations of using ai for geospatial analysis and contributing to improving the package
#### Started off with a cheatsheet with some functions that I found to be commonly used, that you can also refer in API reference here https://geoai.gishub.org/utils/
